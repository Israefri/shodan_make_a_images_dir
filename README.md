# shodan_make_a_images_dir
the program takes a search result and takes only the images and insert it to a different dir in your local machine *LINUX ONLY*
shell script - using the CLI u can read about it at the docs of shodan 
python - moving throught the banners and getting the images and moving it to other dir that called images
(the python are not my code)
how to make it work:
1. go to shodan get your api key (under account) 
2. check that ure linux machine has shodan if not follow the doc steps to download it
3. downloa the shell script and the python script to THE SAME dir 
4. start by doing chmod 777 <sh/py file> (important for the script to work)
5.than run the script by ./<sh name>
6. follow the steps and youre welcome
